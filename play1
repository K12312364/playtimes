# Peanut Butter Jelly Time!

# First Goal: Create a program that can tell you whether or not you can make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich

# Second Goal: Modify that program to tell you: if you can make a sandwich, how many you can make

# Third Goal: Modify that program to allow you to make open-face sandwiches if you have an odd number of slices of bread ( )

# Fourth Goal: Modify that program to tell you: if you're missing ingredients, which ones you need to be able to make your sandwiches

# Fifth Goal: Modify that program to tell you: if you have enough bread and peanut butter but no jelly, that you can make a peanut butter sandwich but you should take a hard, honest look at your life. Wow, your program is kinda judgy.


# What are the step-by-steps to recreate this?
# First, you need variables to store your information. Remember, variables are just containers for your information that you give a name.

# You need three ingredients to make a PB&J, so you'll want three different variables:
# How much bread do you have? (make this a number that reflects how many slices of bread you have)
bread=3
print bread
# How much peanut butter do you have? (make this a number that reflects how many sandwiches-worth of peanut butter you have)
pb=14
print pb
# How much jelly do you have? (make this a number that reflects how many sandwiches-worth of jelly you have)
jelly=12
print jelly
# For this exercise, we'll assume you have the requisite tools (plate, knife, etc)

# Once you've defined your variables that tell you how much of each ingredient you have, use conditionals to test whether you have the right amount of ingredients

# Based on the results of that conditional, display a message.

# To satisfy the first goal:
# If you have enough bread (2 slices), peanut butter (1), and jelly (1), print a message like "I can make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich";
# If you don't; print a message like "Looks like I don't have a lunch today"
if bread==2 and pb==1 and jelly==1:
    print "I can make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich"
elif bread!=2 and pb!=1 and jelly!=1:
    print "no pb&j"

# To satisfy the second goal:
# Continue from the first goal, and add:
# If you have enough bread (at least 2 slices), peanut butter (at least 1), and jelly (at least 1), print a message like "I can make this many sandwiches: " and then calculate the result.
# If you don't; you can print the same message as before
sandwiches=bread/2
if bread>=2 and pb>=1 and jelly>=1:
    print "I can make this many sandwiches", sandwiches

elif bread!=2 and pb!=1 and jelly!=1:
    print "no pb&j"

# To satisfy the third goal:
# Continue from the second goal, and add:
# If you have an odd number of slices of bread* and odd amount of peanut butter and jelly, print a message like before, but mention that you can make an open-face sandwich, too.
if bread>=2 and pb>=1 and jelly>=1:
    print "I can make this many sandwiches:",sandwiches,
    
if bread % 2 == 1 and bread/2 <= pb and bread/2 <= jelly and jelly >= 1 and pb >= 1:
    print "plus one open face sandwich"

    print "\n I can have open-faced sandwiches:", sandwiches % 2,
else:
    print "no food for me"

# If you don't have enough ingredients; still print the same message as before
# * To calculate whether you have an odd number, see https://github.com/shannonturner/python-lessons/blob/master/section_01_(basics)/simple_math.py

# To satisfy the fourth goal:
# Continue from the third goal, but this time if you don't have enough ingredients, print a message that tells you which ones you're missing.
goodonbread=2
goodonpb=1
goodonjelly=0
if not goodonbread:
    print "\n need more bread"

if not goodonpb:
    print "\n need more pb"

if not goodonjelly:
    print "\n uh o goodonbread goodonpb but need more jelly"


# To satisfy the fifth goal:
# Continue from the fourth goal, but this time if you have enough bread and peanut butter but no jelly, print a message that tells you that you can make a peanut butter sandwich
# Or if you have more peanut butter and bread than jelly, that you can make a certain number of peanut butter & jelly sandwiches and a certain number of peanut butter sandwiches

if goodonbread==2 and goodonpb==1 and goodonjelly==0:
    print "I am not goodonjelly so I can only have pb"
